- methods of lexical and syntactic analysis with a detailed study of parsing methods by unwrapping;

- methods of syntactically controlled translation.

 ### Be able to:

- use Backus-Naur forms to specify the syntax of a formal language;

- use software tools to build lexical analysers;

- perform parsing based on the left-handed recursive descent method;
